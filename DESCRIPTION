Title: Utilities functions for my master thesis on multilevel machine learning
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Paolo Colussi
Maintainer: Paolo Colussi <p.colussi@uu.nl>
Description: Implements utility functions developed for a master thesis on multilevel machine learning.
    The package provides implementations of Generalized Mixed-Effects Regression Trees (GMERT)
    and Generalized Mixed-Effects Random Forests (GMERF), including optimized variants based on
    precomputed cluster-level matrix inverses. It also includes tools for simulating clustered
    binary data under logistic mixed-effects models, performing cluster-wise train/test splits,
    generating predictions from fitted models, and computing classification performance metrics
    such as class-specific F1 scores. These methods are designed for hierarchical data structures
    commonly encountered in applied statistical and machine learning research.
